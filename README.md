# One-Hot-Encoding
One-hot encoding is a technique used in machine learning and data preprocessing to convert categorical variables into a binary format that can be provided to algorithms. This method transforms each category into a new binary column, where 1 indicates the presence of the category and 0 indicates its absence.

Why Use One-Hot Encoding?
Many machine learning algorithms work better with numerical input rather than categorical data. One-hot encoding helps to:

Avoid the assumption of ordinal relationships in categorical data.
Enable the model to treat each category equally without implying any hierarchy.
Enhance model performance by improving interpretability.
How It Works
Given a categorical variable with n unique categories, one-hot encoding will create n new binary columns. For example, if we have a feature Color with categories Red, Green, and Blue, the transformation will look like this:

Color	Red	Green	Blue
Red	1	0	0
Green	0	1	0
Blue	0	0	1
Usage
This project provides an easy-to-use implementation of one-hot encoding. You can integrate it into your data preprocessing pipeline with minimal effort.

Installation
bash
Copy code
pip install one-hot-encoder
Example
python
Copy code
from one_hot_encoder import OneHotEncoder

data = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red']
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(data)

print(encoded_data)
